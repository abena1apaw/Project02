As a exercise enthusiast, I can look up the proper way to do shoulder presses, tricep dips, and bicep curls. I did not include all exercises in the exercise page and search box allows for the user to look-up any exercise possible with motion described.
As a reiki practioner the meditation page also includes a search box for ideas for better meditation practices and massage techniques. 
As a student in dietics school, I can look at the website as inspiration for a weight loss management.
